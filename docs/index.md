# AI/ML Pipeline Workshop

## Synthetic Data Generation, Multimodal LLM Evaluation, and Network Analysis

![Workshop Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Workshop Date**: January 23, 2026
**Funded by**: Jetstream2
**Platform**: CyVerse Discovery Environment

## About This Workshop

Welcome to the AI Workbench for Synthetic Data Generation, Generative M-LLM Comparison, and Network Building! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to build an AI/MLOps pipeline that:

1. Generates synthetic images using Google Gemini API
2. Uses Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) to generate labels and captions
3. Performs semantic evaluation of generated content
4. Builds network structures to understand thematic representations

This workshop focuses on a social movement case study, using synthetic data generation to address data privacy concerns while maintaining research value.

## Workshop Registration

**[Enroll in the Workshop](https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/208)** to access the CyVerse Discovery Environment and all workshop resources.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will understand:

1. AI/MLOps pipeline creation using Open Source CARE principles
2. Synthetic data generation techniques
3. Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs)
4. Centrality measures for network analysis
5. Human-in-the-Loop evaluation methods

## Workshop Structure

The workshop follows three main stages:

### 1. Data Collection and Evaluation
Generate synthetic images based on a fictional scenario combining:
- Atropia data (fictional country news from U.S. military training)
- World Bank synthetic data for an imaginary country
- Public social movement images as visual references

### 2. Model Development
- Train and fine-tune models on data subsets
- Generate image labels and captions using M-LLMs
- Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics
- Process text data (lemmatization, emoji translation, hashtag normalization)

### 3. Model Deployment
- Build semantic similarity networks
- Perform community detection analysis
- Visualize thematic patterns and relationships

## Getting Started
